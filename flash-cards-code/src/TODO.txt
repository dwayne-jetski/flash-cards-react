1. remove component if we do not need it. 
2. check database name on mongodb config. db-name is blank may cause errors. I think we need to create a database and then load the data.
3. for the main page, we could use the boot strap album template, and dynamically create an album for each entry?
4. Need to install React-Strap helper for bootstrap in react npm install --save reactstrap react react-dom
